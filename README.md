# Hey there! 👋

- 👋 **Who am I?** Just your friendly tech tinkerer, coffee-dependent coder, and wordsmith with an English degree. I’m not saying I’m wise, but my cat thinks I am.
- 👀 **What I do:** Press buttons, break things, Google the solution, fix it, then act like it was intentional. Occasionally, I write words in a way that makes people think I know what I’m doing.
- 🌱 **Currently learning:** To stop procrastinating... eventually. Also, diving into tech wizardry to help others feel like tech sorcerers.
- 💼 **Work with me if:** You have a stash of tech jokes or need someone to argue about the Oxford comma.
- 📫 **Find me online:** If you’re clever enough to spell my name, you’re already halfway there. LinkedIn is a solid bet!
- 😄 **Pronouns:** He/Him, or just “Hey, you!” works fine too.
- ⚡ **Fun fact:** I can speak English well enough to sound intelligent and techy enough to confuse my relatives.

> Life motto: "Turn it off and on again, but with style."
